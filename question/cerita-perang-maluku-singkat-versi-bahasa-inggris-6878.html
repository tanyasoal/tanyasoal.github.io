                            <p class="h1 fs-6 lh-base mb-0">MEETING MY IDOL    Afgan has always been my favourite <br>
 singer. I had always been thinking of how<br>
 I would feel when I met him. Then I was<br>
 suddenly hit by lightning when I found out<br>
 Afgan was coming to town for a concert in a<br>
 local auditorium. A day before the concert,<br>
 there would be a meet-and-greet event at a<br>
 local radio station. Feeling excited, I packed<br>
 all my Afgan’s CDs to get his signature at the<br>
 event.<br>
 On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station<br>
 was full of Afganism (that’s how Afgan’s fans are called). They sat<br>
 on the chairs prepared inside the radio station’s lobby. Some stood<br>
 in rows in the front yard of the radio station. A spot inside a lobby<br>
 was prepared with a mini stage for Afgan’s singing performance<br>
 and a table for Afgan to sign Afganism’s memorabilia. Finally, after<br>
 about 40 or 50 minutes wait, Afgan showed up from inside the<br>
 radio station. He smiled and waved to all Afganism who had been<br>
 waiting excitedly saying, “Good morning. How are you all?”. The<br>
 crowd went crazy. The shouts sounded like a mix of “Fine, thank<br>
 you” and screams of Afgan’s name. <br>
 Then, he started the event by singing his hit single “Dia<br>
 dia dia”. Afganisme went even crazier; they sang along with him<br>
 throughout the song. Of course, I did too. I couldn’t take my eyes<br>
 off this amazing singer who had released three albums. When he<br>
 was finished with the song, the host announced that it was time<br>
 for autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and began<br>
 to stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless.<br>
 It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was really cool<br>
 seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normal person,<br>
 which was awesome. He asked my name so that he could write it<br>
 on the CD to say “To Mia, Love Afgan”. He was also very friendly, so<br>
 I didn’t feel too nervous when I had a chance to take pictures with<br>
 him. He was just an amazing person. And it was the best day ever!<br>

                            <p class="h1 fs-6 lh-base mb-0">Mangrove Trees”    A mangrove is a tropical marine tree. Mangroves have special aerial roots and salt-filtering tap roots which enable them to thrive in brackish water. Brackish water is salty but not as salty as sea water.<br>
<br>
Mangrove trees are commonly planted and found in coastal areas. Mangroves can serve as walls of protection for natural disaster in coastal area like tsunami. According to BBC News, healthy mangrove forests had helped save lives in the Asia disaster tsunami and people tended to respect these natural barriers even more, especially after the tsunami.<br>
<br>
There are several species of mangrove tree found all over the world. Some prefer more salinity, while others like to be very-close to a large fresh water source such as river. Some prefer areas that are sheltered from waves. Some species have their roots covered with sea water every day during high tide. Other species grow on dry land but are still part of the ecosystem. The Times of India reported that rare species of mangrove had been found and was also known as the looking-glass tree, probably because the leaves are silver-coated.<br>
<br>
Mangroves need to keep their trunk and leave above the surface of the water. Yet they also need to be firmly attached to the ground so they are not moved by waves.<br>
<br>
Any part of root that appears above the water flows oxygen to the plant under water surface. as the soil begin to build up, these roots procedure additional roots that become embedded in the soil.<br>

 Medical treatment during the American Civil War (Subject)was (predicate) extremely poor. It has been estimated that 64.582 died of their battle wounds. Thousands of men had to have limbs amputated. Where possible chloroform was used but in many cases the patient had to rely on whisky while being operated on. The greatest danger facing soldiers during the war was not bullets but disease. It is believed that 186.216 soldiers died of a variety of different illnesses during the conflict. Large numbers of the soldiers came from rural areas and had not been exposed to common diseases such as chicken pox and mumps. Living in unhealthy conditions and often denied properly medical treatment, soldiers sometimes died of these diseases. For example, 5.177 soldiers in the United Army died of measles during the war. The main killer diseases were those that resulted from living in unsanitary conditions. In 1861 typhoid caused 17 per cent of all military deaths, whereas dysentry and diarrhea caused a sick rate of 64 per cent of all the troops in the first year of the war. The following year this figure reached 99.5 per cent.</p>
