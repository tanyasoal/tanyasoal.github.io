                                        <div>School Valedictory<br>Assalamu’alaikum wr.wb<br>With all due respect to the honorable Mr. Principal, to the honorable homeroom teachers and other teachers as well as to my dearest friends.<br>First of all, let’s say our praise and gratitude to the Allah Swt the One and Almighty because of His grace and blessing upon us so that on this good occasion today we can still gather and meet up altogether at this blissful place in the best of our health.<br>Shalawat and salam may always be upon our adoration and shining model, Prophet Muhammad Saw, upon all of his companions, friends, families, and not forget all of us as his followers, who will insya Allah always be obedient to his teachings.<br>To all the honorable audience,<br>Allow me on the behalf of all of my friends to convey a few words and messages regarding this farewell ceremony.<br>Time flies, it has been 3 years going since our first time to be in this school. Tough, happy, we have experienced and gone through together. And today is the top-end of our days. We will be taking a leave each other and there will be no more togetherness and cohesiveness we will find in the future.<br>Every single of beautiful story we had here will only be a piece of memories in the future. One day later we will definitely be missing beautiful times like this.<br>Not forget, we are really thankful to all of the teachers of this school for teaching us the meaning of struggle that finally have brought us to this gateway that leads us to the real life. Without them, we would be nothing. There a lot of things they have taught us, even though sometimes we felt tired, fed up, bored, yet with all of their hearts and patience they stayed teaching and guiding us. To my friends, I wish that this farewell and leaving could somehow tighten our solidarity and I hope this leaving will not be the end of everything.<br>Go all-out for your goals, My Friends! So that you can get a better living in the future. I wish everything we had in here all this time could be some knowledge that Insya Allah would become all useful and all-to-the good for the sake of people, nation, and religion, and the most important is for our own selves. Aamiin.<br>I think that’s all I could convey to everyone here. Please, forgive me for the more and less and all of mistakes on my words because mistakes come from human while superiorities come from Allah Swt. Thank you for the attention.<br>Wabilahitaufik walhidayah wassalamu’alaikum wr.wb<br></div>
