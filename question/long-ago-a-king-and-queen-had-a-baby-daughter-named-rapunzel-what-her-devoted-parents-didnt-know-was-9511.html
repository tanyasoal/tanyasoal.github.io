Inside, Rapunzel found a sparkling gold object. It was so familiar.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFlynn Rider awoke and found himself tied to a chair with Rapunzel&#039;s long, golden hair. Rapunzel pointed to her painting of the floating lights.Tomorrow was her eighteenth birthday. If Flynn took her to see the lights, she\u2019d return his satchel.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nAfter Flynn agreed to help, Rapunzel used her hair to climb down from the tower.&lt;br&gt;\r\nShe&#039;d never been outside before! But when her feet touched the grass, Rapunzel nearly burst with excitement, exclaiming, \u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nRapunzel and Flynn enjoyed their adventure, but they were being chased! Mother Gothel was looking for them.&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe royal guards were after Flynn, and so were his angry partners in crime. They wanted the crown!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n Days passed, and Rapunzel and Flynn managed to escape their pursuers.&lt;br&gt;\r\nOne morning, Rapunzel saw a breathtaking sight: a beautiful kingdom with a castle sitting high above. She headed straight to it!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn the town, Rapunzel was drawn to a painting of the King, the Queen, and their baby, who was known as the lost princess.&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe child had golden hair and green eyes... just like her!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFlynn rowed Rapunzel out to view the floating lights, which were actually lanterns!&lt;br&gt;\r\nFlynn gave Rapunzel her own lantern to send into the night, and she returned the crown.&lt;br&gt;\r\nThen the couple gazed into each other&#039;s eyes. They were falling in love.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nLater, Flynn and Rapunzel were separated. Mother Gothel told Rapunzel that Flynn had only wanted the crown.&lt;br&gt;\r\nBut she realized Mother Gothel was lying!

She wanted Rapunzel to stay with her forever.&lt;br&gt;\r\nIf she did, she\u2019d allow Rapunzel to heal Flynn. But before Rapunzel could act, Flynn cut off her hair, which lost its magic.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nWithout the magic, Mother Gothel quickly aged and turned to dust. Rapunzel was now free, but Flynn was dying.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\u201cYou were my new dream,\u201d he whispered. One of Rapunzel\u2019s tears fell on Flynn and began to glow... and healed him!&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nFlynn brought Rapunzel back to the castle.

Rapunzel and Flynn enjoyed their adventure, but they were being chased! Mother Gothel was looking for them.<br>
The royal guards were after Flynn, and so were his angry partners in crime. They wanted the crown!<br>
