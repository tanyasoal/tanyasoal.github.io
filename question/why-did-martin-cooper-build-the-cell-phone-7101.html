                                        <div>The Maluku War (1817)<br>    The Portuguese were the first Europeans to master Maluku in 1512, followed by the Spanish. Then followed the British control of the Moluccas in 1811. Based on the Convention of London (1814), the Moluccas submitted by the British to the Netherlands. The Netherlands then adopted monopoly trade practices in Maluku, and carried out other actions that were very harmful to the people of Maluku. Among them are "honey shipping" and "extirpation" which is the act of cutting nutmeg and clove trees that violate monopoly rules.<br><br>    As a result of the suffering experienced by the people of Maluku, there arose the reaction and resistance of the people of Maluku in 1817 under the leadership of Thomas Matulessy or better known by the name Kapitan Pattimura, a former sergeant major in the British army service. Pattimura is assisted by several other fighters, among others, Anthony Rhebok, Thomas Pattiwael and a female warrior Christina Martha Tiahahu.<br><br><br>    The first attack on the Netherlands was launched on the night of 18 May 1817. This attack succeeded with the burning of post boats in Porto (port). The next day they attacked the Fort Duurstede and captured it. At that time Resident Van Den Berg and his family and his guard at the fort were killed.<br> <br>Fort Duurstede<br>    To retaliate and recapture the fortress Duurstede, the Dutch brought reinforcements from Ambon to Haruku on May 19, 1817. The aid was a force of 200 men and led by a major. They concentrated their strength on the Zeelandia fortress.<br> <br>Fort Zeelandia<br>    The kings of Maluku mobilized their people to attack the fortress of Zeelandia. The Dutch broke through the siege of the people and continued their journey to Saparua. There was a fierce battle in Saparua. Many fell victim on the side of the Dutch army. Thus the Pattimura troops succeeded in defending the fortress Duurstede.<br><br>    This glorious victory adds the morale of the people of Maluku, so that resistance extends to other areas such as Seram, Hitu and others. Resistance of the people in Hitu, handled by Ulupaha (80 years). Because of his treachery to his own nation, Ulupaha finally pressed and caught by the Dutch.</div>

                                        <div>The Maluku War (1817)<br><br> The Maluku War led by Kapitan Pattimura initially occurred when the Dutch returned to power in 1817, the monopoly was reintroduced. Reapplied the economic system of banknotes that are very hated and out orders of the system of forced labor (rodi). The Dutch did not seem to support and observe the existence of the Protestant church and the proper management of Protestant schools. During the Dutch East Indies colonial rule, the monopoly in Maluku continued. The burden of the people is getting heavier. In addition to compulsory submission, still must be subjected to obligations of forced labor, delivery of salted fish, jerky, and coffee. Those who violate are dealt with firmly. The actions of the Dutch East Indies government caused more suffering<br>and misery to the people, this is the cause of the people angry and the outbreak of war maluku. The people of Saparua (Maluku) fought against the Dutch colonial government under the leadership of Pattimura or Thomas Matulessy and female warrior Christina Martha Tiahahu.<br><br> The Maluku people's resistance began by burning the Pos boat in Porto (harbor) on May 15, 1817 and besieging Fort Duurstede. The next day the people managed to control the fort and shot dead the Maluku Resident, Van De Berg. On May 14, 1817, Pattimura began leading the resistance to the Netherlands, especially in Porto. Dutch difficulties, finally the Dutch asked for help from Ambon. The army sent as many as 200 men in July 1817. For the second time the Dutch came to Saparua and managed to control the Fort Duurstede in August 1817.<br><br> Maluku fighters then continue the struggle with the guerrilla system. The Dutch wanted to immediately arrest the leaders of the resistance. In addition to deploying a large army, the Netherlands also announced that they would be awarded 100 Guilders to anyone who could catch Pattimura and 500 Guilders for other leaders. However, the people of Maluku are not tempted by the gift. In October 1817, the Dutch desired to immediately complete the war. For that reason the month the Dutch mobilized his troops on a large scale. In the end, Pattimura and other leaders were arrested by the Dutch, and on December 16, 1817 Pattimura was hanged in Ambon City. In the Maluku War also known heroine, Christina Martha Tiahahu and often nicknamed Pearl of the East, who participated<br>fought against the Dutch despite his young age (17 years) and died January 1, 1818 in exile (exile) on the island of Java.<br><br>#semogamembantu<br><br>JADIKAN JAWABAN TERBAIK</div>

                            <p class="h1 fs-6 lh-base mb-0">Mangrove Trees”    A mangrove is a tropical marine tree. Mangroves have special aerial roots and salt-filtering tap roots which enable them to thrive in brackish water. Brackish water is salty but not as salty as sea water.<br>
<br>
Mangrove trees are commonly planted and found in coastal areas. Mangroves can serve as walls of protection for natural disaster in coastal area like tsunami. According to BBC News, healthy mangrove forests had helped save lives in the Asia disaster tsunami and people tended to respect these natural barriers even more, especially after the tsunami.<br>
<br>
There are several species of mangrove tree found all over the world. Some prefer more salinity, while others like to be very-close to a large fresh water source such as river. Some prefer areas that are sheltered from waves. Some species have their roots covered with sea water every day during high tide. Other species grow on dry land but are still part of the ecosystem. The Times of India reported that rare species of mangrove had been found and was also known as the looking-glass tree, probably because the leaves are silver-coated.<br>
<br>
Mangroves need to keep their trunk and leave above the surface of the water. Yet they also need to be firmly attached to the ground so they are not moved by waves.<br>
<br>
Any part of root that appears above the water flows oxygen to the plant under water surface. as the soil begin to build up, these roots procedure additional roots that become embedded in the soil.<br>

 Medical treatment during the American Civil War (Subject)was (predicate) extremely poor. It has been estimated that 64.582 died of their battle wounds. Thousands of men had to have limbs amputated. Where possible chloroform was used but in many cases the patient had to rely on whisky while being operated on. The greatest danger facing soldiers during the war was not bullets but disease. It is believed that 186.216 soldiers died of a variety of different illnesses during the conflict. Large numbers of the soldiers came from rural areas and had not been exposed to common diseases such as chicken pox and mumps. Living in unhealthy conditions and often denied properly medical treatment, soldiers sometimes died of these diseases. For example, 5.177 soldiers in the United Army died of measles during the war. The main killer diseases were those that resulted from living in unsanitary conditions. In 1861 typhoid caused 17 per cent of all military deaths, whereas dysentry and diarrhea caused a sick rate of 64 per cent of all the troops in the first year of the war. The following year this figure reached 99.5 per cent.</p>
